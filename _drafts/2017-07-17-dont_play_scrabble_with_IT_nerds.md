# *"Are abbrevations and names allowed?"*

\- the nerd in the party asks shyly. *"Ahh... Yeah, why not. Otherwise it could get too difficult."* - someone answers a little bit too quickly. They took the bait. Remaining a perfect poker face the nerd reaches out for the bag of the sweetest fruits in the whole game. It almost does not matter what he'll draw out of it - surely there'll be multiple possibilities for him to make numerous combinations of valid names. Not any names of course - we're talking about valid, full names of **Linux packages and commands**.
