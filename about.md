My name is Raphael Emberger and I'm studying computer science at the [Zurich University for Applied Sciences (ZHAW)](https://www.zhaw.ch/).

I got into programming by 2012 when I started to build **Excel** workbooks thanks to a minor event at school or at work which I actually can't recall anymore. It didn't take long for me to heavily struggle with the basic Excel functions which lead to learning about the possibility of using **VBA** in Excel. You can probably imagine how that happened: Googling for a solution to a problem and you find a completely new way of solving it - in my case that was VBA. So I had lots of fun with it for a couple of months before I wanted more. So I grabbed myself **Visual Studio 2012** and started learning **VB.NET** in the fall '12.

Then a 2 year period followed where I expanded my knowledge and programmed many different applications. Here are some examples:

- a **3D-spline renderer**
- a **calculation library** for more complex mathematics
- Excel addins to **convert tables to ASCII** or to **crack any restriction on an Excel file**
- a wrapper to **convert richtext files to standard pages via LaTeX**(Oh yeah, somewhere along the way I picked up LaTeX too - because it's awesome)
- a tool to **do maths with chemicals**
- an **internet disconnector** to forcefully focus on work
- a **multithreaded downloader class**
- a tool to **change file timestamps**
- a tool to **stream and download movies**
- a tool to **draw distance considering crosshairs for a shooter game**
- a **linear algebra calculator**
- a **class for modeling websites**
- a **YouTube downloader** (if interested, check out my recent [follow up](/2017/06/23/youtube_downloader_1))
- a tool to **list newest songs from beatport and searching them on YouTube**
- a **wrapper for Xbox controllers**
- a tool to **calculate k values of the "everything formula"**
- a **drifting mod for GTA V**
- a **Runge-Kutta library**
- and many, many more...

Some of those projects were never completed, but most of them worked back then.

So I enrolled into ZHAW in '14 and studied mechanical engineering because I used to be a constructer. Since then I didn't have much time for programming. Fortunately I realized one year and a bit later, that I wasn't content with what I was majoring in and decided that computer science was the way to go. However, I was a bit too late for switching right away to CS and therefore I didn't drop out immediately - instead I only attended courses I could transfer to my future cs studies: Analysis, numerics and such.

And here I am, studying computer science. And I love it(not everything of course, but in general I do).
